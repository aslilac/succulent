# Code of Conduct

Any conduct related communications should be directly with me, [Kayla](mailto:mckayla@hey.com).

-   Spamming, trolling, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

-   This is a safe and welcoming environment for people of every of level of experience,
    gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
    ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

-   Treat everyone kindly. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.

-   Personal attacks are not okay. Actionable feedback about behavior, code quality, or
    implementation is okay. Critique about other unrelated things will most likely be
    considered inappropriate, and un-actionable feedback should be kept to a minimum.
